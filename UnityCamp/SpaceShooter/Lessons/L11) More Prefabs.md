# L11) More Prefabs

Remember when we made a Projectile Prefab? Now let's make an Enemy Prefab

## Review: What is a Prefab?

Prefabs are **REUSABLE** Game Objects which simplify **RECREATING** objects we already made.

## Make the Enemy a Prefab

1. In the **Hierarchy**, select the Enemy Game Object
2. Click and Drag it into the **Project Files** section at the bottom of your screen.

## That's it!
