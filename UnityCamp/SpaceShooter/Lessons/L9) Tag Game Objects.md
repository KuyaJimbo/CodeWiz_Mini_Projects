# L9) Tag Game Objects

Before we can continue we need to give out game objects **Tags**

## What are Tags and why do we need them?

A Tag is an **property of a game object** which helps **define the kind of game object** something is.

- The player might have **Player** Tag
- Many different enemies might all have an **Enemy** Tag
- Projectiles might have a **Projectile** Tag

## Tag the Player Object with "Player"

1. Select the **Player Object** in the **Scene**
2. At the top of the **Inspector** click on the **Tag drop-down menu**
3. Select **Player**

## Tag the Enemy Object with "Enemy"

Their is no "Enemy" Tag so we need to make out own.

1. Select the **Enemy Object** in the **Scene**
2. At the top of the **Inspector** click on the **Tag drop-down menu**
3. Click **Add Tag...**
4. Click the **+** under the **Tags** Box
5. Name the New Tag **Enemy** and click **Save**
6. Re-select the **Enemy Object** in the **Scene**
7. At the top of the **Inspector** click on the **Tag drop-down menu**
8. Select **Enemy**

## Tag the Projectile Object with "Projectile"

Their is no "Projectile" Tag so we need to make out own.
