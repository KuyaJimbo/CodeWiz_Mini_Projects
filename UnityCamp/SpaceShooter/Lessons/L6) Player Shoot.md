### // HOW TO CREATE A VARIABLE:

// Variables have 3 parts:

// **Access_Type**: how we can access the variable (public/private)

// **Data_Type**: what type of data the variable holds (int, float, string, etc.)

// **Variable_Name**: the name of the variable (should be descriptive of what it does)

### // Challenge 1: Create a PUBLIC PROJECTILEPREFAB variable (Data Type: GameObject)

    public GameObject projectilePrefab;

### // Challenge 2: Create a PUBLIC shootSound variable (Data Type: AudioClip)

    public AudioClip shootSound;

### // Start is called before the first frame update

    void Start()
    {

    }

### // Update is called once per frame

    void Update()
    {

        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
        {
            // INSTANTIATE creates a GAMEOBJECT at a POSITION with a ROTATION
            Instantiate(projectilePrefab, transform.position, Quaternion.identity);

            // PLAYCLIPATPOINT plays an AUDIOCLIP at a specific position in the game world
            AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint(shootSound, transform.position);
        }
    }

}
