# L14) Production Upgrade Prefab

This lesson teaches how to make a Prefab for the Production Upgrade

## What is a Prefab?

Prefabs are **REUSABLE** Game Objects which simplify **RECREATING** objects we already made.

## Make the Production Upgrade Button a Prefab

1. In the **Hierarchy**, select the Production Upgrade Button Game Object

2. Click and Drag it into the **Project Files** section at the bottom of your screen.

## That's it! Now make a few more Production Upgrades with the Prefab!

1. Select the Prefab from the **Project Files** Section 

2. Drag the Prefab into the **Canvas Object** inside the **Hierarchy**

## Adjust the Position of the new Production Upgrade Button

1) Double-Click on the **Canvas** Object in the **Hierarchy** to Zoom our focus on it

2) Select the **Production Upgrade Button** Object use the **Move Tool**

## Set the new Upgrade's Default Values

1) Return to Unity, and look for the ProductionUpgradeCode Component in the Inspector

2) Change the numbers for the Cost, Boost, and Count

#### Here's an Example:

    Cost: 100
    Boost: 2
    Count: 0

## Remember, these are called VARIABLES!

Variables store information or values.   

## Also, change the Text inside the new Production Upgrade so it shows the right cost and Boost

#### Here's an example:

    +2 Cookie Per Second

    Cost: 100 Cookies

## Now test your game!
