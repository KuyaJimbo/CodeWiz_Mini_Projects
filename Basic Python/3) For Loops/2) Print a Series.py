# range(start, stop, step)
# start = the first number
# end = the number where the loop stops
# step = the size between each number

# Example: Print numbers from 0 to 10
# for number in range(0,11,1):
#     print(number)

# Read an integer for the start
start = 

# Read an integer for the stop
stop = 

# If the start is less than the stop, the numbers are increasing (step = 1)


# Else, the numbers are decreasing (step = -1)


# Make the for loop: range(start, stop + step, step)
