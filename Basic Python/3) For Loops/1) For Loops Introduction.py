# Here are some examples of a 'For Loop' that prints the numbers from 0 to 4
for number in [0,1,2,3,4]:
    print(number)

# Can you make a 'For loop' that prints the numbers from 5 to 10?
for number in []:
    print(number)

# [0,1,2,3,4] is a LIST we had to type manually. 

# What if we want all the numbers from 0-10?
# [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] is a lot of typing!

# We can use the 'range()' function instead

# range(start, stop, step)
# start = the first number
# end = the number where the loop stops
# step = the size between each number

# Example: Print numbers from 0 to 10
for number in range(0,11,1):
    print(number)

# Your Turn! 
# 1) Print numbers from 0 to 20
for number in range():
    print(number)


# 2) Print numbers from 25 to 50



# 3) Print EVEN numbers from 30 to 40 (Hint: Step = 2)



# 4) Print numbers from 10 to back to 1 (Hint: Step = -1)



# 5) Print numbers 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100 with the range function
