index % 3 == 0   - True when the index is divisible by 3
string[index]    - character at position index

# Read a string:
string = input()

# STEP 1: Loop through the string by index
# Hint: use range(len(string))

# STEP 2: Check if the index is divisible by 3 (index % 3 == 0)

# STEP 3: If it is divisible by 3, SKIP printing that character

# STEP 4: Otherwise, print the character
# Hint: use end="" to keep everything on the same line
