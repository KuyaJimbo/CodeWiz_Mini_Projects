# Read a string:
string = input()

# STEP 1: Find the index of the first "h"

# STEP 2: Find the index of the last "h"

# STEP 3: Slice the string into 3 parts:
#   - everything before the first "h"
#   - everything from the first "h" through the last "h"
#   - everything after the last "h"

# STEP 4: In the middle part, replace all "h" with "H"

# STEP 5: BUTâ€¦ make sure the very first and very last "h" stay lowercase
# Hint: you may want to keep the first and last letters separate

# STEP 6: Print all the parts joined back together
