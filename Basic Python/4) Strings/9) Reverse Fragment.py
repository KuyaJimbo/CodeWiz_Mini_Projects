# Read a string:
string = input()

# Find the index of the first "h"
# Find the index of the last "h"

# Slice into 3 parts:
#   - everything before the first "h"
#   - everything from the first "h" through the last "h"
#   - everything after the last "h"

# Reverse the middle part (hint: use step -1)

# Print all the pieces joined back together
