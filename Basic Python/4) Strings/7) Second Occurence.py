len(word) - how many characters are in the string
word.count("f") - how many "f" in the string

# Read a string:

# Count the number of occurences of the letter "f" 
count = string.count("f")

# if f is not in the string
    
    # print -2


# else if f shows up once in the string
    
    # print -1

    # find the first index using find()

    # find the second index with find( "p" , first_index + 1)
