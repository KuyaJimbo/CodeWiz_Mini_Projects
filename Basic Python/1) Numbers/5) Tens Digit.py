# Remember that Floor Division gets rid of the decimal part
# FLOOR DIVISION (//) - LEFT MOST DIGITS
#   1234  //  10   = 123
#   1234  //  100  = 12
#   1234  //  1000 = 1

# Remainder gives you the leftover part of the division
# REMAINDER (%) - RIGHT MOST DIGITS
#   1234  %  10    =       4
#   1234  %  100   =      34
#   1234  %  1000  =     234

# Read an integer:
a = 

# How would you get the last two digits?


# How would you get this number's first digit?
