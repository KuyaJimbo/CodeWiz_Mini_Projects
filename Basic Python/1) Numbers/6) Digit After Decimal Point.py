# Now it's time to read a DECIMAL Number
# We will need to use float(input())

# Read a float:
a = float(input())

# First, let's move the decimal point to the right


# Then, convert to an integer to drop the decimal part


# Finally, use Remainder to get the last digit


# Convert the result to an integer and print:
print(int(a))
