# Read an integer for the students:
students = int(input())

# Read an integer for the apples:
students = int(input())

# There are 3 ways to do the division and get the result as an integer:
# 1. FLOOR DIVISION (//) - divides and rounds down to the integer
# 2. REMAINDER (%) - gives the remainder of the division
# 3. REGULAR DIVISION (/) - divides and gives a decimal number

# Calculate how many apples each student can get without cutting any apples:
fair = 

# Print the fair amount:


# Calculate how many apples will be left in the basket:
leftovers = 

# Print the leftovers:
