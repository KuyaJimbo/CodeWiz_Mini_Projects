# L11) Prefab Variants

What if we wanted to make different kinds of enemies?

## Prefabs are REUSABLE! Create another Enemy for your game

Don't try to remake more enemy Object from scratch! We can use the Enemy Prefab!

1. Drag the **Enemy Prefab** into your **Scene**

2. Change the enemy's **Sprite** with the **Sprite Renderer** component
3. Change the **Scale** of the enemy with the **Transform** component
4. Change the **Speed** of the enemy with the **Enemy Movement** script
5. Right-Click and Reset the **Polygon Collider 2D** to fit the shape

## Make this NEW Enemy a Prefab

1. In the **Hierarchy**, select the new Enemy Game Object

2. Click and Drag it into the **Project Files** section at the bottom of your screen
3. Select **Prefab Variant** in the **Pop-Up window**

## That's it!

Now if we want to make more of this Enemy, we can click and drag them from the **Project Files** Section into the **Scene**

## BONUS: Make more types of enemies for your game!

Here's some ideas:

- BIG enemies that have LOW Speeds
- SMALL enemies that have HIGH Speeds
- LONGER enemies that act as a SHIELD for other Enemies
- Random Space Rocks or other Debris

Have fun with it!
